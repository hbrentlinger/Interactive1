<p>
How are you?
</p>
		<p>
I’m good! I’m still on tour right now with Method Man, Redman, Devin The Dude; going hard in the paint! It’s been real dope so far and great crowds.
		</p>
<p>
Are you happy to be out talking about the new album?
</p>
		<p>
I always love talking about my new music. This is extra special because it’s my tenth solo album.
		</p>
<p>
Did you ever think you’d make it to ten records?
</p>
		<p>
I never thought I would be bigger than Kurtis Blow, let alone put out ten solo albums!
		</p>
<p>
How important is ‘Malice N Wonderland’ within the Snoop Dogg discography?
</p>
		<p>
Classic. Gangsta. West Coast. Timeless music. I went hard in the paint and I think the fans are gonna like what they hear. I stepped my game up and I hope the fans like it, jack!
		</p>
<p>
What would a twenty-two-year-old Snoop Dogg at the outset of his career have thought of 2009’s record?
</p>
		<p>
‘That shit is dope!’ Ha ha ha. I don’t know; you would’ve had to ask me that in ’93. Times have changed after sixteen years in the game, ya feel me?
		</p>
<p>
So, how long were you recording for?
</p>
		<p>
I stay ready so I ain't gotta get ready. I’m a musician - I’m always making music. Kobe Bryant is always playing ball. Well, Snoop Dogg is always recording. There are records on this album that I did a year ago.
		</p>
<p>
What kind of process do you go through when recording an album? Do you just roll through from one record to the next, or do you try and make a clear distinction between them?
</p>
		<p>
One thing about a hit is this - you can’t deny a hit when you hear it. You know it’s a hit and you gonna roll with it like that. Every hit I ever done, I knew it was gonna be a smash. Some smashes are just bigger and better than the previous ones.
		</p>
<p>
So, when you’re working with producers like Dr. Dre and Pharrell, do they come in with a beat or track already planned? Or does it evolve naturally when in the studio?
</p>
		<p>
Both - depends on the day and the mood and the work ethic we are feeling... If we get in the zone we could just be banging out hits all night. There’s no set structure or plan or formula - we just go in there and have fun doin’ what we doin’.
		</p>
<p>
Are there any producers you’d like to get on board who’ve eluded you thus far?
</p>
		<p>
I wanna do a track with The Rolling Stones. I need to collaborate with Mick Jagger!
		</p>
<p>
How would you describe the sound?
</p>
		<p>
Exactly as it is titled - ‘Malice N Wonderland’; gritty, bangin’, happy, feel good music. I got two sides - malice and wonderland . You don’t know what's gonna hit you on this one...
		</p>
<p>
Do you get pissed off with the way in which people try to suggest that your music should fall neatly into a particular genre? That doesn’t sound like hip-hop it’s soul, electro etc.
</p>
		<p>
I make music that sounds good to one person and one person only: Snoop Dogg. If you ain’t down with that, then fuck you!
		</p>
<p>
Surely it’s just pop music? And I don’t mean that in a bad way...
Call it what you want to call it - it sounds damn good to me.
</p>
		<p>
Do you always write from personal experience? Or are you happy to take on a character where necessary?
		</p>
<p>
Snooperman goes in the booth and gets it done. Clark Kent ain’t got shit on me. I write about the shit I see, been through and what I’m about to do. There’s no formula to it - just timeless music.
</p>
		<p>
There are loads of great collaborations on the album...how do these come about? Do you have them in mind for a particular song? Or is it a collaborative process in the studio?
		</p>
<p>
I got R Kelly, Lil Jon, Jasmine Sullivan, Soulja Boy, Problem, Terrace Martin, Nipsey Hussle, Brandy, Pharrell, The Dream - they all my homeys... I fuck with them because they make a dope product and you can’t deny a good thang, ya dig?
</p>
		<p>
Your sound has changed with the times and tracks like ‘Drop It (Like It’s Hot)’ have led the way for others. ‘Malice N Wonderland’ seems to fall into the latter category and really sets out a potential route for hip-hop as we enter a new decade. Where do you see things going in the next ten years?
		</p>
<p>
Follow me and you’ll see. I been in the lane for almost twenty years and I’m pretty sure I’m gonna be doing it for another ten. It’s good that everyone does their own thang and forces others to step their game up. Competition is a good thing and is definitely needed in hip-hop.
</p>
		<p>
Is it true you're making a short film similar to Murder Was The Case to accompany the release?
		</p>
<p>
Malice N Wonderland Mini Movie; be on da lookout. Shit is dope! We just shot it last week - I can’t tell you too much, other than it’s a definite classic.
