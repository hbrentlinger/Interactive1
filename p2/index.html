Without thinking, do an impression of Snoop Dogg. Piece of piss ain’t it? Simply corrupt the etymology of our mother tongue with a liberal smattering of Izzles or Schnizzles and voila; you too can be a West Coast hip-hop icon. 
			</p>


			<p>
For added authenticity why not introduce a smattering of references to your gangland past by dangling a blue hanky from your jean pocket ala the Crips and harping on constantly about what a ruddy great blast it is being a comic-book appropriation of a pimp? It is well funny. Youse all look proper gangster!
			</p>

			<p>

Imagine then the disappointment - nay horror - when on tracking down Snoop Dogg for a pow-wow (you heard!) about his tenth studio album, ‘Malice N Wonderland’, he refrained from dropping a single Izzle suffix into the conversation. Not a one. How the fuck are we supposed to have cultural stereotypes if the originators don’t play along? Answer me that Snoop. Answer me! And he could have, if we’d asked. But truth be told Charles Edward Broadus-Smyth (AKA Snoop Dogg) is well hard and we’re not... So we didn’t. A member of the Crips (a notoriously violent LA street gang) when still in High School. Three years spent in chokey for cocaine possession. Cleared over charges relating to the murder of Phillip Woldemariam in 1996. To précis; he is not to be riled.

			<p>
Yet despite a public persona which overtly trades on some of the more dubious elements of his background and the active encouragement of romanticized misogyny in the guise of the pimp caricature within urban American folklore, Snoop Dogg has nonetheless become the family-friendly face of hip-hop. Where other artists would see this mainstream assimilation as a dichotomy without resolution, Snoop Dogg has embraced his role without emasculation; cannily balancing avant-garde masterpieces such as ‘Drop It (Like It’s Hot)’ against dicking around as Huggy Bear in the Ben Stiller remake of Starsky And Hutch. 
			</p>
			<p>
Originally known as Snoop Doggy Dogg and ushered into the public eye under the tutorage of N.W.A.’s Dr. Dre, his debut album ‘Doggystyle’ in 1993 wisely focussed on the honeyed laconic drawl, which is still one of the most instantly recognisable voices in contemporary music. Essentially sealing the West Coast dominance within hip-hop for the coming decade through the shrugging irresistibility of his sun-bleached G-Funk, Snoop Dogg’s career has continued to match his rhyming style; unhurried, inimitable and thoroughly satisfying. With his tenth studio album ‘Malice N Wonderland’ now in the bag, we got a jaw on with Snoop Dogg about the new record, why Clark Kent is a wuss and Obama’s basketball skills. Oh, and he kept calling us Jack. That’s how street we are!

<b>How are you?</b>
</p>
		<p>
I’m good! I’m still on tour right now with Method Man, Redman, Devin The Dude; going hard in the paint! It’s been real dope so far and great crowds.
		</p>
<p>
<b>Are you happy to be out talking about the new album?</b>
</p>
		<p>
I always love talking about my new music. This is extra special because it’s my tenth solo album.
		</p>
<p>
<b>Did you ever think you’d make it to ten records?</b>
</p>
		<p>
I never thought I would be bigger than Kurtis Blow, let alone put out ten solo albums!
		</p>
<p>
<b>How important is ‘Malice N Wonderland’ within the Snoop Dogg discography?</b>
</p>
		<p>
Classic. Gangsta. West Coast. Timeless music. I went hard in the paint and I think the fans are gonna like what they hear. I stepped my game up and I hope the fans like it, jack!
		</p>
<p> <b>
What would a twenty-two-year-old Snoop Dogg at the outset of his career have thought of 2009’s record?</b>
</p>
		<p>
‘That shit is dope!’ Ha ha ha. I don’t know; you would’ve had to ask me that in ’93. Times have changed after sixteen years in the game, ya feel me?
		</p>
<p>
<b>So, how long were you recording for? </b>
</p>
		<p>
I stay ready so I ain't gotta get ready. I’m a musician - I’m always making music. Kobe Bryant is always playing ball. Well, Snoop Dogg is always recording. There are records on this album that I did a year ago.
		</p>
<p>
<b>What kind of process do you go through when recording an album? Do you just roll through from one record to the next, or do you try and make a clear distinction between them?</b>
</p>
		<p>
One thing about a hit is this - you can’t deny a hit when you hear it. You know it’s a hit and you gonna roll with it like that. Every hit I ever done, I knew it was gonna be a smash. Some smashes are just bigger and better than the previous ones.
		</p>
<p>
<b>So, when you’re working with producers like Dr. Dre and Pharrell, do they come in with a beat or track already planned? Or does it evolve naturally when in the studio?</b>
</p>
		<p>
Both - depends on the day and the mood and the work ethic we are feeling... If we get in the zone we could just be banging out hits all night. There’s no set structure or plan or formula - we just go in there and have fun doin’ what we doin’.
		</p>
<p><b>
Are there any producers you’d like to get on board who’ve eluded you thus far?</b>
</p>
		<p> 
I wanna do a track with The Rolling Stones. I need to collaborate with Mick Jagger!
		</p>
<p><b>
How would you describe the sound?
</p></b>
		<p>
Exactly as it is titled - ‘Malice N Wonderland’; gritty, bangin’, happy, feel good music. I got two sides - malice and wonderland . You don’t know what's gonna hit you on this one...
		</p>
<p> <b>
Do you get pissed off with the way in which people try to suggest that your music should fall neatly into a particular genre? That doesn’t sound like hip-hop it’s soul, electro etc.
</b> </p>
		<p>
I make music that sounds good to one person and one person only: Snoop Dogg. If you ain’t down with that, then fuck you!
		</p>
<p> <b>
Surely it’s just pop music? And I don’t mean that in a bad way...
Call it what you want to call it - it sounds damn good to me.
</p>
		<p>
Do you always write from personal experience? Or are you happy to take on a character where necessary? </b>
		</p>
<p>
Snooperman goes in the booth and gets it done. Clark Kent ain’t got shit on me. I write about the shit I see, been through and what I’m about to do. There’s no formula to it - just timeless music.
</p>
		<p> <b>
There are loads of great collaborations on the album...how do these come about? Do you have them in mind for a particular song? Or is it a collaborative process in the studio? </b>
		</p>
<p>
I got R Kelly, Lil Jon, Jasmine Sullivan, Soulja Boy, Problem, Terrace Martin, Nipsey Hussle, Brandy, Pharrell, The Dream - they all my homeys... I fuck with them because they make a dope product and you can’t deny a good thang, ya dig?
</p>
		<p> <b>
Your sound has changed with the times and tracks like ‘Drop It (Like It’s Hot)’ have led the way for others. ‘Malice N Wonderland’ seems to fall into the latter category and really sets out a potential route for hip-hop as we enter a new decade. Where do you see things going in the next ten years?
		</b> </p>
<p>
Follow me and you’ll see. I been in the lane for almost twenty years and I’m pretty sure I’m gonna be doing it for another ten. It’s good that everyone does their own thang and forces others to step their game up. Competition is a good thing and is definitely needed in hip-hop.
</p>
		<p> <b>
Is it true you're making a short film similar to Murder Was The Case to accompany the release? </b>
		</p>
<p>
Malice N Wonderland Mini Movie; be on da lookout. Shit is dope! We just shot it last week - I can’t tell you too much, other than it’s a definite classic.
